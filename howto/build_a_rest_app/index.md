This document shows you how to build a more advanced SMART App with server-side
logic and REST API Calls.

You should first read the [Main Page](../../) and [HOWTO Build a SMART App](../build_a_smart_app).

# Server to Server Authentication

When your app was making JavaScript API calls, authentication and authorization
were entirely transparent to you, the app builder, because the SMART Container
was able to take care of it all: the JavaScript API call simply notified the
outer frame of the data request, and the outer-frame knows who the logged-in
user is and what medical record they're currently considering.

Now, we consider the case where you want the backend of your app to obtain data
directly from the SMART Container, e.g. the SMART Reference EMR, using the REST
API. In that case, the SMART Container doesn't know a-priori who is making the
call and whether they're authorized to do so. We need to authenticate the call
somehow, and you, the app builder, need to know how to ensure that your calls
are properly authenticated.


## OAuth

For this purpose, we use OAuth, an open-standard for access delegation.

OAuth bundles two important features:

<ol>
    <li>a way to label and sign HTTP requests using an identifier token and a
secret string</li>
    <li>a dance involving the user's browser, the data server, and the server
that wishes to consume the data, which, when the user approves the exchange,
provides the data consumer with the token and secret needed to perform the
authenticated API calls as per (1).</li>
</ol>

SMART employs (1), but implements a much simpler approach to (2), providing your
app with the requisite token and secret. We'll describe this simpler approach
here. At a high-level, your app can simply look for a URL parameter called
`oauth_header` set by the SMART JavaScript client library. In this value, you
will find the OAuth token and secret you need.

## Change Your App's OAuth Consumer Secret in Production (Important!)

Each SMART container your app runs against must first "install" your app
by inserting your app's manifest into it's database. This data includes
your app's OAuth `consumer-secret` which is the shared secret between
your app and the container that __ALL SECURITY__ of your app's
communication with the server relies on and is a basic requirement of
OAuth-signed REST API calls.

<div id='consumer_secret_warning' class='red_box'>
  If this secret is revealed to or guessed by a 3rd party, the security of
  your app and the container has been breached! Using the default secret
  ("smartapp-secret") while in development is acceptable, but:
  <br />
  <br />
  <strong><em>You MUST change the <code>consumer-secret</code> in PRODUCTION!</em></strong>
</div>

This secret is provisioned when your app is loaded into the smart
container with the following command:

    manage.py load_app <manifest-location> <secret>

## Passing Tokens via URL Parameter

The SMART container will pass all necessary fields to your app via the
`oauth_header` URL parameter. Specifically, the actual request sent to your
app's backend server for index.html looks like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
    GET /index.html?oauth_header={Header value here...}
{% endhighlight  %}

You need to first extract that header from the GET parameter:

{% highlight javascript %}
    oauth_header = web.input().oauth_header
{% endhighlight  %}

You'll also to need to URL-decode it:

{% highlight javascript %}
    oauth_header = urllib.unquote(oauth_header)
{% endhighlight  %}

The field contains a complete OAuth Authorization header that includes a few
extra fields, including notably smart_record_id, smart_oauth_token and
smart_oauth_token_secret. smart_record_id indicates the medical record ID
of the current context, while the OAuth token and secret are the credentials
your app needs to make REST API calls back into the SMART EMR. Why, then, are
they themselves delivered in OAuth authorization header format? So you can
verify that these tokens are authentic before you actually use them!

In other words, the SMART container is sending you credentials you can use to
sign your API request. Those credentials are, themselves, signed, so you know
they're okay to use.

Thankfully, you don't need to worry too much about the details, because we
provide you with the utilities you need to extract the fields you need quickly
and efficiently:

{% highlight javascript %}
    # parse it into a python dictionary
    oauth_params = oauth.parse_header(oauth_header)
{% endhighlight  %}

Then get the specific parameters you need to sign your own API calls:

{% highlight javascript %}
    record_id = oauth_params['smart_record_id']
    resource_credentials = {'oauth_token':        oauth_params['smart_oauth_token'],
                            'oauth_token_secret': oauth_params['smart_oauth_token_secret']}
{% endhighlight  %}

The SMART Connect OAuth Header contains a few more parameters that will prove
useful:

<ul>
  <li>`smart_app_id`: the identifier of the app being invoked</li>
  <li>`smart_container_api_base`: the base URL for API calls into the SMART EMR</li>
</ul>

Now, why would your app need these, since presumably it knows its own ID and
where the SMART container is located to make API, right?

In the simple case, yes, but in more advanced cases, your backend server might
support multiple simultaneous apps made available to multiple SMART Containers.
Thus, in a given setting, your app needs to know definitely which SMART
Container it's connecting to and, if you're using one server to host multiple
apps, which of your apps is being invoked in the first place.

## Using SMART Client Libraries

Read up on the SMART Python Library.

Using those instructions, you can instantiate a SmartClient with the 
credentials obtained above:

{% highlight javascript %}
    client = SmartClient('my-app@apps.smartplatforms.org',
                         {'api_base' : 'http://sandbox-api.smartplatforms.org'},
                         {'consumer_key' : 'my-app@apps.smartplatforms.org',
                         'consumer_secret' : 'smartapp-secret'},
                         resource_credentials)
{% endhighlight  %}

Since we're working against the SMART Reference EMR Sandbox, the APP_ID and
consumer-level credentials are all fixed. Of course when connecting against a
different SMART Container (e.g. your own), those will probably change.

# Obtaining SMART Health Data

With our smart_client instance ready to go, loaded with the right credentials,
we can start making API calls. Let's get the medication list:

{% highlight javascript %}
    medications = smart_client.get_medications(record_id = record_id)
{% endhighlight  %}

Just like in the first SMART App we built, the result is an SMARTResponse object
containing an RDF graph of data, which we can query for just the fields we want:

{% highlight javascript %}
    query = """
        PREFIX dcterms:<http://purl.org/dc/terms/>
        PREFIX sp:<http://smartplatforms.org/terms#>
        PREFIX rdf:<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
        SELECT  ?drugname ?rxcui
        WHERE {
           ?med rdf:type sp:Medication .
           ?med sp:drugName ?drugname_code .
           ?drugname_code dcterms:title ?drugname .
           ?drugname_code sp:code ?rxcui_url .
           ?rxcui_url dcterms:identifier ?rxcui .
        }
        """
 
    med_names_and_cuis = medications.graph.query(query)
    meds = [{'name': med[0], 'rxcui': med[1]} for med in med_names_and_cuis]
{% endhighlight  %}    

So far, we're not doing anything novel compared to our SMART Connect App. Let's
make use of this fully capable backend we have, and integrate this data with
other information. We'll use [RxNav](http://rxnav.nlm.nih.gov/), the National
Library of Medicine's resource for RxNorm. In particular, we'll pull out the
ingredients for each medication:

{% highlight javascript %}
    for med in meds:
      rxnav_info_xml = urllib.urlopen("http://rxnav.nlm.nih.gov/REST/rxcui/%s/related?rela=has_ingredient" % med['rxcui']).read()
      info = ElementTree.fromstring(rxnav_info_xml)
      med['ingredients'] = [ing.text for ing in info.findall('relatedGroup/conceptGroup/conceptProperties/name')]
{% endhighlight  %}

Most of that code above is to quickly parse the XML we get back from RxNav and
obtain the ingredient names.

Now that we've combined the SMART record data with a third-party data source, we
can just render our HTML:

{% highlight javascript %}
    meds_html = "\n".join(["<li>%s<br /><small>ingredients: %s</small><br /><br /></li>" % (str(med['name']), ", ".join(med['ingredients'])) for med in meds])
{% endhighlight  %}

and we're done.

(Note that we're using clunky string concatenation to produce our HTML. Of
course we recommend using a templating system, but we didn't want to burden the
explanation with a templating language at this point.)
