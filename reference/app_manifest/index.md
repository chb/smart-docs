# Introducing SMART Manifests

Each SMART app should provide a JSON manifest to declare itself to the
container. This manifest defines the app's name, ID, a description, and its
application mode.

If you're building a straightforward SMART UI App, here's a template you can use
for your manifest file. Just replace the ALL-CAPS placeholders with your own
values.

{% highlight javascript %}
  {
    "name" : "YOUR APP NAME",
    "description" : "BRIEF DESCRIPTION FOR IN-LINE DISPLAY",
    "author" : "YOUR NAME",
    "id" : "CHOOSE-AN-ID@apps.smartplatforms.org",
    "version" : "YOUR.VERSION.NUMBER",

    "mode" : "ui",
    "scope": "record",

    "index" : "http://PATH/TO/YOUR/index.html",
    "icon" : "http://PATH/TO/YOUR/icon.png"
  }
{% endhighlight  %}


# Application Modes

SMART Applications can run in one of three modes:

* The UI Apps mode (`ui`): These apps interact with the user in the context
  of the SMART container. Several of the sample apps fall in this category
  the Med List, Problems List, and Got Statins apps. These are SMART's "normal"
  apps.

* The Frame UI Apps mode (`frame_ui`): These apps can launch and layout
  multiple apps side-by-side. Apps in this category include: i2b2 EMR View,
  as well as our [Frame UI Sample](/howto/how_to_build_smart_frame_ui_apps).
* The Background Apps mode (`background`): perform some function automatically

  in the background. A sample app in this category is the Surescripts Connector,
  which automatically gets a Surescripts dispensing history for each patient
  record and updates the medications list accordingly. 


# Sample Manifest Files

A UI App provides an index file and an icon. Optionally, the manifest file can
declare the SMART container version and the API calls that the app needs. For
example, this is the Meds List app manifest:

{% highlight javascript %}
  {
    "name":        "Med List",
    "description": "Display medications in a table or timeline view",
    "author":      "Josh Mandel, Children's Hospital Boston",
    "id":          "med-list@apps.smartplatforms.org",
    "version":     ".1a",

    "mode" : "ui",
    "scope": "record",

    "icon" : "http://localhost:8001/framework/med_list/icon.png",
    "index": "http://localhost:8001/framework/med_list/index.html",

    "smart_version": "0.4",

    "requires" : {
      "http://smartplatforms.org/terms#Medications": {
        "methods": ["GET"]
      },
      "http://smartplatforms.org/terms#Demographics": {
        "methods": ["GET"]
      }
    }
  }
{% endhighlight  %}


A background app needn't provide an icon or activities. For example, the
Surescripts Connector provides the following manifest:

{% highlight javascript %}
  {
    "name":        "SMART Connector",
    "description": "Keeps SMART updated from a SureScripts feed (long-term, runs in background)",
    "author":      "Josh Mandel, Children's Hospital Boston",
    "id":          "smart-connector@apps.smartplatforms.org",
    "version":     ".1a",

    "mode" : "background"
  }
{% endhighlight  %}


# Validating Your Manifest

The API Verifier app has a facility for validating SMART manifests. You can
either launch the app on the sandbox container or in standalone mode from this
URL <http://apiverifier.smartplatforms.org/smartapp/index.html>. Click on the
"Manifest" tab, copy in your manifest's text, then click the "Validate" button
to validate.
