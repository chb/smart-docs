## RxReminder: SMART REST in Action

<div class='simple_small_box'>{% include githublink %}</div>

You should read [HOWTO Build a SMART App - REST API](../build_a_rest_app) Calls
first.

## Choosing the right tools

Since you can write a SMART REST app in any language using any toolkit, there's
a lot of flexibility. In general, you'll want to look for a language with
existing OAuth libraries to handle the details of signing requests to the SMART
container. Here we'll illustrate the highlights with a simple python-based SMART
REST app called *RxReminder. RxReminder* is written using the web.py HTTP
Framework, but we won't delve into [web.py](http://webpy.org/) here. All you
need to understand is that web.py provides a simple mechanism to map python
functions to URLs.

Code snippets are provided below, but please see [the full source tree on
github](http://github.com/chb/smart_rx_reminder).

## App Structure

First, recall that every SMART UI app must serve: `index.html` which loads
smart-api-client.js to provide the app's functionality.

Just like the app in the HOWTO, we serve the index file as follows in webpy:

{% highlight python %}
  urls = ('/smartapp/index.html,' RxReminder')

  class RxReminder:
    def GET(self):
        # good stuff coming here

{% endhighlight  %}


## Initializing the SMART API Client

Now we're getting to the fun part: handling requests for index.html. We'll be
using the Python SMART API client libraries to interact with the SMART
container. For authentication, we'll use the OAuth token and secret provided in
a URL parameter that came along with the request for our index.html, just like
in the HOWTO.

{% highlight python %}
   smart_oauth_header = web.input().oauth_header
       smart_oauth_header = urllib.unquote(smart_oauth_header)

       # Pull out OAuth params from the header
       oa_params = oauth.parse_header(smart_oauth_header)
       resource_tokens={'oauth_token':       oa_params['smart_oauth_token'],

  'oauth_token_secret':oa_params['smart_oauth_token_secret']}

       # instantiate the smart client
       client = SmartClient(SMART_SERVER_OAUTH['consumer_key'],
                            SMART_SERVER_PARAMS,
                            SMART_SERVER_OAUTH,
                            resource_tokens)
{% endhighlight  %}

If you're building your application from scratch without using the sample code,
you'll want to define SMART_SERVER_OAUTH and SMART_SERVER_PARAMS:

{% highlight python %}
  # Basic configuration:  the consumer key and secret we'll use
  # to OAuth-sign requests.
  SMART_SERVER_OAUTH = {'consumer_key': 'my-app@apps.smartplatforms.org',
                        'consumer_secret': 'smartapp-secret'}


  # The SMART container we're planning to talk to
  SMART_SERVER_PARAMS = {
      'api_base' : 'http://sandbox-api.smartplatforms.org'
  }
{% endhighlight  %}


## Generating Reminders

Now that we've got access tokens, and initialized a client object, let's
interact with some health data! *RxReminder* needs to get a list of medications
due for refills. We'll accomplish this by finding the most recent fulfillment
event for each medication. Then we'll look at how many days' supply of
medication were dispensed to find out on what day the patient will run out.

We use our SmartClient object called client to fetch a SMART Response object
including a list of medications, via `get_medications() (or, in more
verbose form, client.get("/records/%s/medications/{record_id}")` SMART API call.

Then we'll get fancy with RDF, running a SPARQL query to find a list of fills
for each medication in meds.graph. Finally, we'll loop through the fills to find
the most recent one, using the dispensed quantity to determine when the patient
will run out of medication.


{% highlight python %}
    # Represent the list as an RDF graph
    meds = client.get_medications()

    # Find a list of all fulfillments for each med.
    q = """
        PREFIX dc:<http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/>
        PREFIX dcterms:<http://purl.org/dc/terms/>
        PREFIX sp:<http://smartplatforms.org/terms#>
        PREFIX rdf:<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
           SELECT  ?med ?name ?quant ?when
           WHERE {
                  ?med rdf:type sp:Medication .
                 ?med sp:drugName ?medc.
                  ?medc dcterms:title ?name.
                  ?med sp:fulfillment ?fill.
                  ?fill sp:dispenseDaysSupply ?quant.
                  ?fill dc:date ?when.
           }
        """
    pills = RDF.SPARQLQuery(q).execute(meds.graph)

    # Find the last fulfillment date for each medication
    self.last_pill_dates = {}

    for pill in pills:
        self.update_pill_dates(*pill)

    #Print a formatted list
    return header + self.format_last_dates() + footer
{% endhighlight  %}

The details of finding the most recent prescription are in the update_pill_dates
function. Please [check out the source on github](http://github.com/chb/smart_rx_reminder)
